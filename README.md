# Project-Recipes
My first website and git repository.
This website will have some of my favorite recipes. There will be pictures and a list of 
ingredients and steps for a person to follow and make some good food. There are pan fried potatoes, french toast, and pizza. They are all some good meals for any time of the day in my opinion. I was using vim for the first time here and I am really starting to like it.
